# Solar-System-Simulation

This program runs a realistic simulation of the solar system. It has the sun at the center and
the first 4 planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. It follows a realistic revolution pattern.

The program gets the planet and universe information from the command line when the program is run. It takes
the amount of time the user wishes the simulation to run and the change in time. Faster change in time makes the
simulation run faster. The universe gets its information and the planet info from the "planets.txt" file
included. To change planet info or universe info edit that file. 

Music and fonts are open source.
