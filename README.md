# Solar-System-Simulation

This program runs a realistic simulation of the solar system. It has the sun at the center and
the first 4 planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. It follows realistic revolution.

The program gets the planet universe information from command line when the program is run. It takes
the time the user wishes the simulation to run and the change in time. Faster change in time makes the
simulation fun faster. The universe gets the planet info from the "planets.txt" file included. To change
planet info or universe info edit that file.
